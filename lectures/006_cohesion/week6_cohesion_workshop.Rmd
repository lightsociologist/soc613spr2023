## What is a social group?

One of the fundamental goals of social network analysis is to locate groups of nodes that seem to be "grouped" together. This grouping pattern between nodes can be the result of several factors. For example, there could be exogenous groupings based on affiliation (e.g. work units or afterschool activities) or they could be based on connectivity. Strategies for finding groups in networks use endogenous network properties to identify groups or the propensity to group. 

The most basic way to think about this is density, which of course is at the node level.

First, we need to load the packages for this workshop. **sna** and **network** will be used for blockmodeling. We load them first as they share functions with **igraph** and we want to priortize **igraph**, which we load next. We load **RColorBrewer** so that we can prettify the **igraph** networks and **intergraph** for switching between **igraph** and **network** objects.

```{r results='hide', echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}

library(sna)
library(network)
library(igraph)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(intergraph)
```

## Finding Groups: Zachary's Karate Club

Let's get a quick look at our network for this week: Zachary's Karate Club. The nodes are members of a karate club and edges are interactions. The network occurs just prior to a split between the Teacher (node 1) and the club president (node 34). This is the most common exemplar network. Its popularity inspired me to include the network as the front image of the *Oxford Handbook of Social Networks*.

I have stored the network as an R object that we can simply ``load``.

```{r message=FALSE, echo=T}

load("data/karate.rda")

```

As always we should examine the plot. I want to look at a few things when thinking about groups. For example, the density of the network might be a good initial look at group formation. We also leverage one way of thinking about groups - as ego networks - using the ``make_ego_graph(g)`` function that we set to one for first-order neighbors.

Also note that we store the layout of the graph using the ``layout_with_kk(g)`` function in **igraph** so that each network throughout the workshop can have the same layout by using the ``layout=`` function when plotting networks.

```{r message=FALSE, echo=T}

layout.kk <- layout_with_kk(karate)

kdens <- make_ego_graph(karate, 1) %>%
vapply(graph.density, numeric(1))

plot.igraph(karate, layout=layout.kk, vertex.size=kdens*10)

```

## Defining Groups

Let's start with several basic approaches to locating groups: components, bicomponents, cliques, and cores.

These are basic because there are not estimated by a community detection algorithm, but are more simply defined by node and path characteristics.

## Components

A component is a maximally connected subgraph where every node can be reached. Components could be isolates, dyads, triads, are larger structures, but they are otherwise disconnected from other parts of the network. Strong components are directed and weak components are undirected. The giant connected component is the largest maximally connected subgraph.

A bicomponent is a maximally connected subgraph with at least two paths between each node. Every bicomponent will have at minimum a degree of 2.

We can use ``components(g)`` & ``biconnected.components(g)`` in **igraph**.


First we calculate components.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

V(karate)$name <- c(1:34)

comps <- components(karate)

print(comps$csize)

```

Next, we can calculate bicomponents and plot the bicomponent. ``biconnected.components`` results in several objects, but to pick the subgraph we can select from the list of bicomponents stored as ``$components``. If we want to identify the largest bicomponent we can use ``max(length)``. So, if we store the results of ``biconnected.components`` in an object called biconnected, we can select the largest bicomponent by: 

`bicomponent.org$components[[max(length(bicomponent.org$components))]]`

Next, we use the ``induced.subgraph(g, vids=x)`` function in **igraph** where *g* is the graph and *x* equals the list of vertices that you want to use in the subgraph. Tihs is the results of the above example. 

```{r echo=TRUE}

biconnected <- biconnected.components(karate)

b1 <- biconnected$components[[max(length(biconnected$components))]]

g2 <- induced.subgraph(graph=karate,vids=b1)

plot.igraph(g2)


```

This is a densely connected graph, so it doesn't change to much. Note that the leaf node, 12, is removed.

## Cliques

We may want to know groups of actors that really hang close to one another. Cliques capture one way of thinking about this groupiness. A clique is a maximally connected subgraph (e.g., every node is connected to one another) of at least three nodes. These are essentially groups of closed triads, so they are dense connections. 

In **igraph**:

``cliques(g)`` | ``max_cliques(g)`` | ``largest_cliques(g)``

```{r echo=TRUE}

cliques <- largest_cliques(karate)

c1 <- cliques[[max(length(cliques))]]

clique2 <- induced.subgraph(graph=karate,vids=c1)

plot(clique2)

```


## Cores

k-Cores are more relaxed way of thinking about groups. These are subgraphs where each node is maximally connected to at least k neighboring nodes. Some scholars also think of coreness as a proxy for centrality in very large networks.

``coreness(g)`` in **igraph** cacluates cores. Each node is assigned a k for its largest k-core. We can quickly examine the distribution of largest cores using ``table``in base **R**.

``` {r, echo=TRUE}

kcore <- coreness(karate)    

table(kcore)

```

We can store the core for each node as a vertex or nodal attribute called "core" or whatever using the usual format ``V(g)$core <- kcore`` where kcore is the output for ``coreness(g)``.

We can assign a color to each core in several ways. An effective solution is to use ``brewer.pal`` from **RColorBrewer** to index the core groups as factors and storing them as a vector in these steps:

Grab four colors as there are four core groups.

``thing <- brewer.pal(4, "Set1")`` 

Index to the four as stored as a vertex attribute in the graph. We need this to be a ``as.factor``.

``my_color <- thing[as.numeric(as.factor(V(g)$core))]``

Then we plot the network in **igraph** using ``vertex.color=my_color``. Note there is also a legend example included here.

``` {r, echo=TRUE}


V(karate)$core <- kcore      

coul <- brewer.pal(4, "Set1") 
 
my_color <- coul[as.numeric(as.factor(V(karate)$core))]

plot.igraph(karate, , layout=layout.kk, vertex.color=my_color)
legend("bottomleft", legend=levels(as.factor(V(karate)$core)) , 
col = coul , bty = "n", pch=20 , pt.cex = 3, cex = 1.5, 
horiz = FALSE, inset = c(0.1, 0.1))
 
```

## Cohesion and Cut-Points

K-components are defined by: 
    - (a) the number of nodes that must be removed from the graph to disconnect the components.
    - (b) the number of ties that must be removed from the graph to disconnect the components.

Mathematically, a & b are equivalent.

To locate k-components we first identify cut-points/articulation points. These are nodes whose removal results in the graph splitting apart. These can also be seen as "important" nodes.

``articulation.points(g)`` in **igraph** identify cut points.


```{r echo=TRUE}

art_points <- articulation.points(karate)

rem <- delete.vertices(karate, art_points)

plot(rem)

art.points2 <- articulation.points(rem)

rem2 <- delete.vertices(rem, art.points2)

plot(rem2)

```

## Modularity Maximization

Modularity maximization is a poular way of thinking about “groupiness” within a complete network.

Maximization is:
    - generally thought of as describing a tendency towards having more in-group than out-group ties
    - in-/out- groups are NOT defined on node characteristics (ala homophily), but on tie-patterns
    - typically estimated through divisive/agglomerative assignment or looking at the consequences        of iteratively removing nodes.

Newman-Girvan and Louvain community detection both use modularity maximization.

### Newman-Girvan (fast-greedy) 

Newman-Girvan is a divisive approach:

  - Find edge with highest betweenness & remove
  - Calculate community groups & fitness
  - Iterate over 1-2 (as many as N times)

How to define “fitness”?

  - Community-based mixing matrix (proportion of edges w/in & across groups) 
  - Compute matrix “trace” (the sum of the main diagonal)
  - High values indicate well identified partitions
  - Identify cross-group links (via row/col sums)
  - Modularity = sum of difference between diagonal & off diagonal elements
  - High values indicate a more partitioned / segmented (modular) network
  - Typically examined for local maximization

```{r, echo=TRUE}
fg_comms <- cluster_fast_greedy(karate)

V(karate)$fg_comms <- fg_comms$membership

plot.igraph(karate, layout=layout.kk, vertex.color=V(karate)$fg_comms)

```

### Louvain 

Louvain (Blondel et al. 2008) is a modularity optimization approach:

  -Optimize modularity on all nodes then iterate
  - Does switching the node to another group increase modularity?
  - stop at solution that produces the largest increase in modularity
  - This has been optimized in the Leiden approach (see Leiden pacakge).

```{r, echo=TRUE}

lv_comms <- cluster_louvain(karate)

V(karate)$lv_comms <- lv_comms$membership

plot.igraph(karate, layout=layout.kk, vertex.color=V(karate)$lv_comms)

```

### Leiden

The Leiden algorithm is a variation on Louvain that allows you to adjust a refinement parameter or to generate bigger or smaller groups.

``cluster_leiden(g, resolution_parameter=#)`` in **igraph** with 1 as the default resolution parameter estimates this solution. A higher resolution locates smaller communities, while a lower resolution locates larger groups.

Here we explore a large and a small resolution.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

leid_large_comms <- cluster_leiden(karate, resolution_parameter = 3)

V(karate)$leid_large_comms <- leid_large_comms$membership

plot.igraph(karate, layout=layout.kk, vertex.color=V(karate)$leid_large_comms)


leid_small_comms <- cluster_leiden(karate, resolution_parameter = .25)

V(karate)$leid_small_comms <- leid_small_comms$membership

plot.igraph(karate, layout=layout.kk, vertex.color=V(karate)$leid_small_comms)


```

You can see that the higher resolution is starting to parse smaller bits of the network, here, individual nodes. A very high resolution will basically just put every node into its own community. 

## Random Walks: Walktrap

Walktrap community detection locates subgraphs via random walks. Nodes that are connected via short random walks will be clustered together.

A random walk is exactly as it sounds: Imagine traversing nodes randomly along available edges.

Infomap community detection also uses random walks.

``cluster_walktrap(g)`` in **igraph** detects communities useing walktrap community detection.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

wt_comms <- cluster_walktrap(karate)

V(karate)$wt_comms <- wt_comms$membership

plot.igraph(karate, layout=layout.kk, vertex.color=V(karate)$wt_comms)

```

## Blockmodels

Another way of thinking about groups is to consider how actors or nodes are related based on the patterns of ties that they share. So, instead of being grouped by some type of proximity, groups are formed based on similarity. For example, we could use structural equivalence as a criteria for groupiness. Two nodes are in the same group if they have the exact same ties to one another, line cooks may have the exact same ties to chefs, managers, and other line cooks. Groups based on tie patterns are called blockmodels and this form of blockmodel based on structural equivalence is its most restrictive form. Obviously, these kinds of groups are pretty rare. 

Most common blockmodels are relaxed forms of structural equivalence and allow us to ask which nodes are in similar positions. Blockmodels based on regular equivalence capture groups of nodes that share similar patterns of nodes, but not the exact same nodes such that a prep cook and a line cook could be in the same group if they are connected to similarly structured others (e.g., the same manager, different supervising chef, other prep or line cooks). This has implications for hierachies and for the distributions of resources, such as information.

The hierarchical aspect has been particularly useful in understanding organziations and the world system.

**igraph** doesn't implement blockmodels. So we will use **sna** package instead.

First, we use ``asNetwork(g)`` from **intergraph** to switch from **igraph** to **sna**.

```{r, echo=T, message=F}

knet <- asNetwork(karate)

```

Blockmodeling involves two major steps. 

1. "A partition of actors in the network into discrete subsets called positions."
2. "For each pair of positions a statement of presence or absence of a tie or between positions on each of the relations." (Wasserman and Faust)

After plotting the network in **sna** using the ``plot.network`` function, we can use ``equiv.clust(g)`` to locate clusters. ``equiv.clust`` "computes the distances between all pairs of positions" and ``plot`` the solution which is a dendogram. We can inspect logical places to slice the solution.

```{r, echo=T}

network::plot.network(knet)	

kclus <- sna::equiv.clust(knet, mode="digraph")

plot(kclus)

```


After inspecting the dendogram, we can construct our blockmodel with a 4 block solution given the break around height=25.

``blockmodel(g, k=[# of Blocks])`` in **sna** constructs blockmodels.

```{r, echo=T}

kbm <- sna::blockmodel(knet, kclus, k=4)		

kbm

sna::plot.blockmodel(kbm)	

kbm.mem <- kbm$block.membership

```

We can also plot the block in igraph.

```{r, echo=T}

blks <- data.frame(id=kbm$order.vector, block=kbm$block.membership)

blks <- blks[order(blks$id),]

V(karate)$blocks <- blks$block

plot(karate, layout=layout.kk, vertex.color=V(karate)$blocks)

```

## Compare Modularity

How do we evaluate solutions in terms of community detection. While some of the algorithms intentionally maximize modularity, they may not be the most maximizing. We can compare modularity across solutions using ``modularity(g, membership, weights = NULL, ...)`` in **igraph**.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

mod.df <- data.frame(louvain=modularity(karate, lv_comms$membership), fast_greedy=modularity(karate, fg_comms$membership), leiden_large=modularity(karate, leid_large_comms$membership), leiden_small=modularity(karate, leid_small_comms$membership), walktrap=modularity(karate, wt_comms$membership), blocks=modularity(karate, kbm.mem))

knitr::kable(mod.df)

```

## Example: Legislative Networks

Next, we can include a couple of examples that put community detection to good use. There are, of course, many examples at this point.
